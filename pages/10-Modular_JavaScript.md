### 10.1 Module Systems (CommonJS, ES6 Modules) - Understanding Module Systems

This section introduces the different module systems in JavaScript, such as CommonJS and ES6 Modules. Understanding these systems is crucial for structuring and maintaining scalable JavaScript applications.

// This example demonstrates how to export a function using ES6 module syntax.

### 10.2 Building and Bundling JavaScript

In modern JavaScript development, building and bundling are key processes for optimizing applications. This involves transforming and combining multiple JavaScript files into a single file, often including processes like minification and transpilation. Tools like Webpack are commonly used for this purpose. The example demonstrates a basic Webpack configuration for bundling JavaScript files.

Code Example:
```javascript
//Using Webpack for bundling
const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```

### 10.3 Dependency Management

Dependency management is a critical aspect of modern web development, particularly in large projects with numerous libraries and frameworks. This section focuses on how package managers like npm and Yarn help manage these dependencies, including installing, updating, and configuring various packages in a project. The explanation emphasizes the importance of understanding package.json, semantic versioning, and lock files to maintain consistent and stable dependencies.
