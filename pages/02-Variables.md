# Variables in JavaScript




### 2.1 Declaring and Initializing Variables

Explanation: In JavaScript, variables are declared using 'let', 'const', or 'var'. While 'let' allows reassignment, 'const' is for constants. Here, 'name' is a variable storing a string.

Code Example:
```js copyjs copy
let name = "John";
const PI = 3.14;
```




### 2.2 Data Types and Type Coercion

Explanation: JavaScript supports various data types like numbers, strings, and booleans. Type coercion happens when operators like '+' are used between different types, like concatenating a string and a number.
Code Example:
```js copy
let age = 25;
let message = "My age is: " + age; // Type coercion to string
```




### 2.3 Variable Scope and Hoisting

Explanation: Understanding variable scope and hoisting.
Code Example:
```js copy
console.log(count); // undefined
var count = 10;
```




### 2.4 Variable Naming Conventions

Explanation: Best practices for naming variables in JavaScript.
Code Example:
```js copy
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";
```




### 2.5 Constants and Immutability

Explanation: Introduction to constants and immutable variables.
Code Example:
```js copy
const PI = 3.14159;
```
