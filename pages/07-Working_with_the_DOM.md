### 7.1 DOM Elements, Properties, and Events - Understanding the Basics

This section provides an introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM), a critical concept for web development. The DOM allows developers to interact with and modify the content and structure of a web page using JavaScript.

// This code snippet demonstrates how to access an element by its ID, change its content, and add an event listener.

### 7.2 DOM Manipulation and Traversal

Manipulating and traversing the DOM tree is a fundamental aspect of web development. This involves changing the document structure, style, and content. Traversing the DOM enables the navigation of the node hierarchy to find or manipulate specific elements. The example demonstrates appending a new `div` element to an existing parent element in the DOM.

Code Example:
```js
const parent = document.getElementById("parentElement");
const newElement = document.createElement("div");
parent.appendChild(newElement);
```

### 7.3 Event Handling and Event Delegation

Event handling is crucial for interactive web applications. Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is added to a parent element instead of multiple event listeners on individual child elements. This is efficient for handling events on dynamically added elements and improves performance. The example illustrates event delegation by adding a click event listener to a parent element and handling button clicks within it.

Code Example:
```js
const parent = document.getElementById("parentElement");
parent.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === "BUTTON") {
    alert("Button clicked!");
  }
});
```

### 7.4 Asynchronous Loading and Scripting

Asynchronous loading of scripts is important for improving the performance of web pages. It allows scripts to be loaded in the background without blocking the rendering of the page. This section discusses techniques for loading and executing scripts asynchronously. The provided example demonstrates adding an external script to the document dynamically.

Code Example:
```js
const script = document.createElement("script");
script.src = "external.js";
document.body.appendChild(script);
```
