### 9.1 Writing Unit Tests with Testing Frameworks - Effective Unit Testing

This section covers the essentials of writing unit tests using popular JavaScript testing frameworks. Unit tests are crucial for verifying the functionality of individual code units in isolation.

// This code snippet demonstrates how to write a basic unit test using the Jest framework to test a simple addition function.

### 9.2 Debugging Techniques and Tools

Effective debugging is an essential skill in software development. This section explores various techniques and tools for debugging JavaScript code, ranging from simple console-based methods to advanced debugging in integrated development environments (IDEs). The example demonstrates the use of `console.log` for basic debugging, a common technique for quickly inspecting the state of a program.

Code Example:
```javascript
// Debugging with console.log
function complexFunction() {
  console.log('Entering complexFunction');
  // ...
}
```

### 9.3 Error Logging and Handling in Production

In production environments, robust error handling and logging are vital for diagnosing and addressing issues effectively. This section discusses strategies for capturing and managing errors in a production setting, including logging best practices, error reporting services, and techniques for graceful error handling. While no specific code example is provided, the focus is on the conceptual understanding and best practices for managing errors in live applications.
